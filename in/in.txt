Hi my   name is Hugo and I am a software engineer. I am currently working on a project that involves natural language processing. I am using OpenNLP to accomplish this task. OpenNLP is a library for natural language processing. It is a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution. OpenNLP also includes maximum entropy and perceptron based machine learning.
